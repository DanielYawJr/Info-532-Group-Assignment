        <h2>Mary Thomas</h2> 
        <h3>I graduated with a BBA concentrating in Accounting from Saint Mary's College, Notre Dame, Indiana.  I plan to graduate from Drexel University with my Masters in Information Systems in the spring of 2022.</h3>
        
        <h2>Andrew Szajlai</h2> 
        <h3>I completed my Bachelor of Science in Math and Computer Science at Drexel in June of 2000.  I returned two years ago to complete a Master of Business Administration at the LeBow School of Business.  I’m a security professional by day and an Adjunct Faculty member by night, giving back to the security community with my two ISC certifications.  I use my love for photography and woodworking to relax, please check out some of my favorite photo sites under favorite websites above.  I’m so excited to continue my learning here at the Drexel community as I call it.</h3>

        <h2>Daniel Yaw</h2> 
        <h3>Hi! I'm Dan. I'm a 29 year old Data Engineer and MSIS student at Drexel University. Although my background is primaly in GIS, I am pursuing a carrer in IS. While
        GIS is a great field, it has it's drawbacks. As a senior level GIS professional, new GIS management jobs were few and far between, so I decided to take a different career path.</h3>
