    <h1>Background</h1> 

    Hi! I'm Dan. I'm a 29 year old Data Engineer and MSIS student at Drexel University. Although my background is primaly in GIS, I am pursuing a carrer in IS. While
    GIS is a great field, it has it's drawbacks. As a senior level GIS professional, new GIS management jobs were few and far between, so I decided to take a different career path.
